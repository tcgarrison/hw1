# Homework Assignment #1
## KIEI-924 Winter 2018

### Guidelines for submission

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file (DO NOT clone/"open in desktop").
2. Unzip the ZIP file – this will result in a folder called `hw1-master`.
3. Rename the `hw1-master` folder to `hw1`.
4. Move the `hw1` folder to the top-level of your `code` folder. DO NOT place inside your _username.github.io_ folder or any other subfolders of your `code` folder.
5. Using the GitHub Desktop app, create a new repository (File -> New Repository). The name should be `hw1` and the local path should be your code folder – i.e. `/Users/<your username>/code` (Mac) or `\code` (Windows).
6. Complete the homework per the instructions in the `hw1.js` file.
7. Commit and publish your `hw1` repository to your GitHub account. The finished product should live at `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/hw1`.
